#deprecating the ubuntu base image in favor of alpine.  Much smaller base image.

Demo containers to show off frameworks that display container ID and the version (1 or 2)

## Important Info
This is very far from complete!  This is by no means ready for prime time in any system, just a playground for some stuff I've been working at home to POC Mesos, but simplifying the architecture by containerizing everything - from Mesos to frameworks to helper tools.

## Usage
Very simple container.  It's tagged :v1.0 for version 1, and :v2.0 for version 2.  Great for showing off a framework demo or practicing with simple deployments.
